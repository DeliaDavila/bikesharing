### Purpose
This project was completed to help investors understand Citi Bike bikesharing. Data analysis was performed to determine that bike sharing would work for Des Moines, Iowa. 
### Background
Using available Citi Bike data for New York City, I analyzed aspects of the bike sharing business and identified customers and trends, to determine that yes, bike sharing makes sense for Des Moines. In the results sections below, I’ll review what was analyzed. Note: Use the link above to follow along with interactive data. 

## Results
In the sections below, I cover aspects of the reviewed data. Screenshots are provided here for convenience, but the interactive presentation provided (linked above and here) allows you to adjust filters.

### Checkout Times for Users

As shown in the first graph, the vast majority of trips taken on Citi Bike bikes are under an hour. Hour zero has a huge spike in number of bikes that quickly tapers off for hours after the first hour (Hour zero in the graph). 
Let’s dive into more detail about the people who use Citi Bike.
### Checkout Times by Gender

The second graph shows the breakdown by reported gender. The trip length between male and female looks similar, while the “unknown” gender seems to have more of a spread in how long the bikes were used. This indicates a different kind of rider, as we’ll see in later analysis.
 
### Trips by Weekday per Hour

The third graph shows a distribution of ridership by weekday and by hour. It’s easy to see from this graph that there are two main types of riders, those who commute to work and those who rent the bikes on the weekends for fun. Since New York is a great town for tourism, it’s likely that many of the weekend riders are tourists.
### Trips by Gender (Weekday/hr)

On the fourth graph, the previous graph is broken down by gender as well as weekday and hour. When the “unknown” gender is isolated, it’s easy to see that the ridership is heavily concentrated on the weekend afternoons. There is also a bit heavier use in the early evening hours, regardless of days. This supports the idea that the “unknown” gender actually represents tourists renting the bikes while on vacation. 
### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

In the fifth graph, we breakdown usage by three things: weekday, gender, and type of user. Subscribers pay a monthly fee to use bikes, where the “Customer” type pay per use. This make it clearer that there are really two riderships who use Citi Bike in New York City. Subscribers have accounts so the rider’s gender is known. These riders use bikes most heavily during the week to get to work. Customers, on the other hand, are more distributed across the graph. The heaviest bands are in the “unknown” gender and the weekend days. These are our tourists, who have a lot to see and rent bikes to get around the city during their vacations.
### CustomerType
 
![6_UserType](https://github.com/DeliaDavila/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/6_UserType.png)

The good news for Des Moines Citi Bike is shown in the 6th graph. The customer base is overwhelmingly in the subscriber type. This indicates that there is a demand for regular use of the bikes for commuting and provides a base of operations to grow from. Weekend use by tourists can supplement the business but it’s not the main business, even in a tourist town like New York City. 
### Trip Duration by Age/Type

![7_TripDurationByAgeType](https://github.com/DeliaDavila/bikesharing/blob/main/Images/7_TripDurationByAgeType.png)
The last graph delves into another aspect of the ridership, showing the average trip duration against the rider’s birth year. I added the user type as well. Here again, we see more evidence that the Citi Bike subscriber is a commuter. The trip duration is very consistent for subscribers, regardless of birth year.
